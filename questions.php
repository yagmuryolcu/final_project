The URL Elif visited may contain parameters for redirection or data leakage purposes, even though it looks familiar. The fact that the login screen looks familiar interface-wise doesn't mean the site is actually secure. Such situations can be part of phishing attacks.

The <code>onerror</code> attribute added to the user's profile description works when the image can't load and triggers JavaScript code. This code tries to get cookie information from the user's browser and send it to an attacker's server.
